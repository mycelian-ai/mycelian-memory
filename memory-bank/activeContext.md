# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Major Milestone Completed: Go Client SDK Refactor

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE (2025-08-06)

Successfully completed a comprehensive Go Client SDK refactoring that eliminated over-engineering and established a simpler, more idiomatic Go API.

### Major Architectural Change: API Simplification
**Moved FROM namespaced resources TO direct client methods**
- **Before**: `client.Memories.Create()`, `client.Entries.Add()`, `client.Users.Create()`
- **After**: `client.CreateMemory()`, `client.AddEntry()`, `client.CreateUser()`
- **Rationale**: Eliminated complexity inspired by Stripe SDK pattern, achieved cleaner Go idioms

### Recently Completed (Major Items)

#### ✅ Complete API Restructure
- **Consolidated types**: All request/response types moved to single `client/types.go`
- **Direct method files**: Created dedicated files (`memories.go`, `users.go`, `vaults.go`, `entries.go`, `contexts.go`, `search.go`, `prompts.go`)
- **Preserved async operations**: Maintained executor pattern for `AddEntry` and `PutContext` (FIFO ordering)
- **Updated 50+ test files**: All tests migrated to direct client method pattern

#### ✅ Comprehensive Test Organization
- **New structure**: Implemented `integration_test/mock/` and `integration_test/real/` directories
- **Consolidated overlapping tests**: Merged redundant search integration tests
- **Added MCP transport tests**: New validation for HTTP and stdio MCP transports
- **All tests passing**: Unit, integration, and transport tests verified

#### ✅ Quality & Cleanup
- **Removed deprecated functions**: All `requireUserID()` calls replaced with `ValidateUserID()`
- **Deleted unused files**: Removed `testdata/add_entry_ids.json`, duplicate `memory_service.go`
- **Package reorganization**: Moved `internal/shardqueue/` → `client/internal/shardqueue/`
- **Deleted obsolete packages**: Removed unused `internal/config/`, `internal/resource/`, `namespaces_alias.go`

### Current State: Ready for AWS Stack Development

#### What Works Now
- **Simplified Go API**: Clean, idiomatic `client.Method()` pattern
- **Preserved concurrency**: Async operations (entries, contexts) maintain FIFO ordering via executor
- **Comprehensive testing**: All quality gates passing (`go build ./...`, `go test ./...`)
- **Clean package structure**: Proper separation of concerns, no deprecated code
- **SaaS Strategy**: Clear business model and AWS deployment approach defined

#### Next Development Priorities
1. **AWS Deployment Package**: Create manual deployment code for beta stack
   - Design AWS architecture (Aurora Serverless V2, Weaviate/OpenSearch evaluation)
   - Build deployment scripts for manual AWS setup
   - Configure production environment variables and secrets
2. **Database Simplification**: Complete PostgreSQL consolidation
   - Remove SQLite and Spanner dependencies
   - Standardize on single PostgreSQL dialect
   - Update all storage adapters and tests
3. **SaaS Preparation**: Focus on first paying customers
   - Authentication and billing integration planning
   - Multi-tenant architecture considerations
   - Production monitoring and alerting setup

### Key Patterns Established
- **Direct client methods**: More intuitive than namespaced resources
- **Async preservation**: Critical operations maintain FIFO guarantees
- **Test organization**: Clear separation of unit/mock integration/real integration tests
- **Package consolidation**: Single types file eliminates scattered definitions

### Recent Learnings
- **Stripe SDK pattern**: Auto-generated complexity not suitable for hand-written Go APIs
- **Go idioms**: Direct methods on main struct more natural than resource sub-objects
- **Test organization**: `/mock/` and `/real/` subdirectories clarify test types and scope
- **Async operations**: Some operations (entries, contexts) require preserved executor pattern for correctness

### Strategic Pivot: SaaS-First Approach
- **Business Model**: Focus on first paying customers, not open source
- **Architecture**: Simplified single PostgreSQL dialect
- **Deployment**: AWS-native with Aurora Serverless V2
- **Timeline**: Manual beta deployment, lightweight CI automation before public launch

### Working Branch
- **Branch**: `main` 
- **Status**: Client SDK refactor complete, ready for SaaS deployment
- **Next**: 
  1. **AWS Deployment Package**: Manual deployment code and scripts
  2. **Database Consolidation**: Remove SQLite/Spanner, PostgreSQL only
  3. **Vector Search Evaluation**: Weaviate vs OpenSearch on AWS

### Upcoming Work Sessions
- **Tomorrow**: Start building the AWS stack
  - Design AWS architecture (Aurora Serverless V2, VPC, networking)
  - Evaluate Weaviate vs OpenSearch for vector search
  - Create deployments/aws/ directory structure
  - Begin database consolidation (remove SQLite/Spanner)
- **Following sessions**: Complete AWS beta stack deployment and end-to-end testing
