# Product Context

## Why Mycelian Memory Exists

### The Problem
AI assistants and autonomous agents suffer from context loss between sessions. Current solutions are either:
- **Too simplistic**: Basic chat history without semantic understanding
- **Too coupled**: Tied to specific AI platforms or providers
- **Too limited**: Single-agent focus without collaboration support

### The Solution
Mycelian Memory provides a universal, persistent memory layer that:
- **Persists context** across AI assistant sessions and conversations
- **Enables semantic search** for contextually relevant information retrieval
- **Supports multi-agent collaboration** with shared and private memory spaces
- **Integrates seamlessly** via Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard
- **Scales reliably** from local development to enterprise production

## Target Users

### Primary: AI Application Developers (Paying Customers)
- Building AI assistants that need persistent context
- Requiring multi-session conversation continuity
- Need standardized memory APIs across AI platforms
- Willing to pay for hosted SaaS solution

### Secondary: Enterprise Teams (Revenue Focus)
- Deploying collaborative AI agents for customer support
- Requiring audit trails and compliance features
- Need scalable, production-ready infrastructure
- Budget for premium managed services

## User Experience Goals

### For Developers
- **5-minute setup**: From clone to running local stack
- **Type-safe APIs**: Go SDK with compile-time guarantees
- **Live tooling**: Dynamic schema generation eliminates manual sync
- **Transparent debugging**: Comprehensive logging and error messages

### For AI Agents
- **Seamless integration**: Standard MCP protocol, no custom APIs
- **Context awareness**: Semantic search finds relevant past interactions
- **Collaborative memory**: Shared spaces for multi-agent coordination
- **Session continuity**: Persistent memory across restarts and deployments

### For Operations Teams
- **Observable**: Metrics, logging, and health checks built-in
- **Scalable**: Proven architecture (Aurora Serverless V2) for enterprise scale
- **Secure**: No hardcoded credentials, environment-based config
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns, comprehensive documentation

## Success Metrics
