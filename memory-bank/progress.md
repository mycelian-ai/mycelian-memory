# Progress & Current Status

## What Works ‚úÖ

### Core Memory Infrastructure
- **Memory Service API**: Full CRUD operations for vaults, memories, and entries
- **Go Client SDK**: ‚úÖ **REFACTORED** - Simplified API (`client.Method()`), comprehensive test coverage, clean package structure
- **Vector Search**: Weaviate integration (evaluating OpenSearch for AWS)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL-focused architecture (simplified from multi-database)

### MCP Integration
- **Protocol Implementation**: Complete MCP server with tool registration
- **Live Schema Generation**: Dynamic tool definitions from Go structs (eliminates maintenance debt)
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Successfully tested with Claude Desktop and Cursor

### Build System & Tooling
- **Deterministic Builds**: All binaries output to `bin/` directory
- **Multi-Module Support**: Go workspace coordination across components
- **CLI Tools**: mycelianCli for management, mycelian-service-tools for operations
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Unit, integration, and benchmarking systems

### Development Experience
- **Docker Compose**: Complete local development stack
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: ADRs, runbooks, and API references
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with actionable guidance

## What's Left to Build üöß

### Immediate: AWS SaaS Deployment
**Status**: In Progress - AWS Stack Development
- ‚è≥ **AWS Architecture Design**: Aurora Serverless V2, VPC, networking, IAM roles
- ‚è≥ **Vector Search Evaluation**: Weaviate vs OpenSearch for AWS compatibility and costs
- üöß **Database Simplification**: ‚úÖ Documentation updated, ‚è≥ Remove legacy code dependencies
- ‚è≥ **AWS Deployment Package**: Create deployments/aws/ with manual deployment scripts
- üìã **Authentication Planning**: Multi-tenant access for paying customers

### Short-term: Beta Stack Launch
- **Aurora Serverless V2**: Production PostgreSQL setup
- **Manual Deployment**: Get end-to-end AWS functionality working (beta only)
- **Customer Onboarding**: First paying customer infrastructure
- **Monitoring Setup**: CloudWatch integration for production visibility
- **CI Automation**: Lightweight beta->prod automation before public launch

### Medium-term: SaaS Platform Features
- **Billing Integration**: Usage tracking and payment processing
- **Multi-tenancy**: Secure customer data isolation
- **Enhanced search**: Hybrid search across agent and shared memories
- **Performance optimization**: Caching layer and query optimization

### Long-term: Revenue Growth
- **Additional SDKs**: TypeScript, Rust, and other language bindings
- **Enterprise features**: Advanced analytics, compliance, audit trails
- **Automation**: Infrastructure as code for deployment management
- **Scale optimization**: Auto-scaling and cost optimization

## Current Issues & Blockers

### Technical Debt
- **Database Code Cleanup**: ‚úÖ Documentation updated, ‚è≥ Legacy code dependencies need removal
- **Oversized dependencies**: Legacy database dependencies no longer needed
- **Deployment Gap**: No AWS deployment package yet

### Known Limitations
- **Single-tenant**: No multi-tenancy support yet (required for SaaS)
- **Basic auth**: Environment-based config only, need customer authentication
- **Manual deployment**: Beta only, lightweight CI automation needed before public launch

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Schema Management Evolution
- **v1**: Static JSON schema files required manual synchronization
- **v2**: Live schema generation from MCP server ‚úÖ
- **Result**: Eliminated maintenance debt, single source of truth

### Build System Evolution
- **v1**: Nested cmd directories in each module
- **v2**: Centralized `bin/` directory with deterministic paths ‚úÖ
- **Result**: Improved developer experience, simplified CI/CD

### Business Model Evolution
- **v1**: Open source project with multiple database backends
- **v2**: SaaS-first approach with simplified PostgreSQL architecture üöß
- **Result**: Faster time to market, clear revenue path

### Architecture Evolution
- **v1**: Multi-database architecture (multiple backends)
- **v2**: PostgreSQL-only for simplicity and focus üöß (‚úÖ Documentation, ‚è≥ Code cleanup)
- **Result**: Reduced complexity, faster development, AWS-optimized

## Success Stories

### ‚úÖ Documentation Refactoring for Postgres-Only Architecture (Current)
Completed comprehensive cleanup of documentation to reflect simplified database architecture:
- **‚úÖ CLAUDE.md**: Updated service management, architecture diagrams, and database commands for Postgres
- **‚úÖ DEVELOPER.md**: Removed all legacy database references, updated setup instructions and debugging guides
- **‚úÖ key-concepts.mdc**: Updated Memory Service Backend description to reflect Postgres backend
- **‚úÖ Memory Bank**: Updated all core files to reflect current state and completed work
- **Result**: Consistent documentation that accurately reflects Postgres-only architecture

### ‚úÖ Go Client SDK Refactor (2025-08-06)
Completed major architectural simplification of the Go Client SDK:
- **API simplification**: Moved from `client.Resource.Method()` to `client.Method()` pattern
- **50+ files updated**: All tests migrated to new direct method pattern
- **Quality verified**: All builds pass, comprehensive test coverage maintained
- **Async operations preserved**: Critical FIFO ordering maintained for entries/contexts
- **Clean package structure**: Types consolidated, deprecated code removed

### ‚è≥ AWS Stack Development (Starting Tomorrow)
Next major milestone: Build production AWS infrastructure for beta customers
- **Scope**: Manual deployment package for Aurora Serverless V2 + vector search
- **Goal**: End-to-end AWS functionality for first paying customers
- **Timeline**: Complete beta stack before public launch automation

### Benchmarking Integration
Successfully integrated Python benchmarker with live MCP schema loading:
- Dynamic tool discovery eliminates manual schema maintenance
- 12 tools loaded and validated automatically
- Deterministic binary path resolution works across environments

### CLI Refactoring Success
Completed comprehensive CLI rename without breaking existing functionality:
- 17 files changed, 289 insertions, 255 deletions
- All integration points updated (Makefile, Python clients, documentation)
- Deterministic build paths maintain compatibility

### Multi-Module Stability
Go workspace approach provides clean development experience:
- Independent module versions and dependencies
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy local development with replace directives
