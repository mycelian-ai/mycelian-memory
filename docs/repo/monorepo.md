# Mycelian Monorepo Layout

## Why we structure it this way

- **Hide server code** – All backend code lives in `internal/`, so nothing outside the repo can import it. This lets us refactor without breaking users.
- **One repo, many modules** – The server and each language SDK live side-by-side in one repository and are linked with a `go.work` (for Go) or their native lock files.  Each SDK is versioned and released independently.
- **Clear layers** – Code is grouped by its job so each concern stays separate and easy to swap.
- **Tiny cmd/** – Binaries just wire things together; real work stays in libraries so tests run fast and releases stay small.

## Versioning

Each component follows **Semantic Versioning** (`vX.Y.Z`).
- Bump **Z** for backwards-compatible fixes.
- Bump **Y** for new features that keep the public contract intact.
- Bump **X** only when a change breaks compatibility.

⚠️ **Pre-1.0.0**: any **Y** bump may introduce breaking changes.

The server and every language SDK (`clients/go`, `clients/python`, `clients/ts`, `clients/rust`, …) are tagged and published **independently**, but every server release records the _minimum compatible_ SDK versions in `VERSIONS.md`.

CI blocks a server tag unless:
1. Updated stubs compile for every language.
2. All per-language SDK test suites pass.

This guarantees contract coherence across languages.

| Component                | Tag example            | Publication target        |
|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Go SDK                   | `clients/go/v0.4.0`    | pkg.go.dev module         |
| Python SDK               | `clients/python/v0.2.1`| PyPI (`mycelian-memory`)  |
| TypeScript SDK           | `clients/ts/v0.3.0`    | npm (`@mycelian/memory`)  |
| Rust SDK                 | `clients/rust/v0.2.0`  | crates.io (`mycelian`)    |
| Server                   | `server/v0.8.0`        | ghcr.io Docker image      |

> CI ensures that any change to files under `api/` regenerates stubs, runs each language’s test suite, and bumps the affected SDK’s version tag **before** the server can be released.

## Adding features

- Public API changes begin with updates to the contracts in `api/`.
- Generated SDK code lives under `clients/generated/<lang>` (if used) and is committed so CI can diff changes.
- Hand-written helpers or ergonomic layers live in the same language folder (e.g. `clients/go/client/`, `clients/python/src/mycelian/`).
- Promote shared functionality out of `internal/` only after a design review.

## Staying tidy

- Keep generated code in separate sub-directories and exclude them from manual edits.
- Update this document whenever the directory structure changes.
