# Security Audit Findings - Memory Backend

**Date**: January 26, 2025  
**Auditor**: Security Analysis  
**Severity Levels**: 🔴 Critical | 🟠 High | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low

## Executive Summary

This security audit has identified multiple vulnerabilities ranging from critical authentication bypass issues to medium-severity input validation concerns. The most critical finding is the **complete absence of authentication and authorization mechanisms**, allowing unrestricted access to all user data.

## Critical Vulnerabilities 🔴

### 1. No Authentication or Authorization
**Location**: Entire API surface  
**Impact**: Complete system compromise  

The API has no authentication mechanism whatsoever. Any user can:
- Access any other user's data by knowing/guessing their userID
- Create, read, update, or delete any user's memories and vaults
- Access sensitive personal information without restrictions

**Evidence**:
- No auth middleware in `internal/api/router.go`
- No token validation or session management
- UserID passed as URL parameter with no verification

**Recommendation**: Implement OAuth2/JWT authentication immediately with proper authorization checks.

### 2. Predictable Resource Identifiers
**Location**: `internal/storage/spanner.go`  
**Impact**: Information disclosure, unauthorized access  

While UUIDs are used, they are:
- Exposed in URLs without access control
- Not validated against the authenticated user
- Allows enumeration attacks if UUIDs can be predicted or leaked

**Recommendation**: Always validate that the authenticated user has permission to access the requested resource.

### 3. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
**Location**: Multiple locations in storage layer  
**Impact**: Data breach, data manipulation  

Several SQL queries use string concatenation or insufficient parameterization:
- Dynamic query building in `ListMemoryEntries` with user-controlled parameters
- Potential injection points in search functionality

**Evidence**: 
```go
// Dangerous pattern found in multiple places
query += " AND CreationTime < @before"  // String concatenation
```

**Recommendation**: Use parameterized queries exclusively, never concatenate user input into SQL.

## High Severity Issues 🟠

### 4. Insufficient Input Validation
**Location**: `internal/api/validate/validate.go`  
**Impact**: XSS, injection attacks, data corruption  

Current validation is minimal:
- Email validation uses basic regex, missing edge cases
- No sanitization of HTML/JavaScript in text fields
- JSON metadata fields accept arbitrary content without validation
- Title validation allows only basic characters but no Unicode consideration

**Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization.

### 5. Sensitive Data in Logs
**Location**: Multiple service files  
**Impact**: Information disclosure  

Sensitive data is logged without redaction:
- User emails logged in plaintext
- Memory IDs and user IDs exposed in logs
- No log sanitization for PII

**Evidence**:
```go
log.Info().Str("email", req.Email).Msg("Creating user")
```

**Recommendation**: Implement structured logging with PII redaction.

### 6. No Rate Limiting
**Location**: API endpoints  
**Impact**: DoS attacks, resource exhaustion  

No rate limiting on any endpoints allows:
- Brute force attacks on user enumeration
- Resource exhaustion through bulk operations
- Potential database overload

**Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting per IP and per user.

### 7. Insecure Default Configuration
**Location**: `internal/config/config.go`  
**Impact**: Misconfiguration vulnerabilities  

Issues identified:
- Hardcoded GCP project ID in defaults
- No secrets management (all config from environment variables)
- Development mode enabled by default
- Emulator endpoints exposed without authentication

**Recommendation**: Use secure defaults and external secrets management.

## Medium Severity Issues 🟡

### 8. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Location**: All state-changing endpoints  
**Impact**: Unauthorized actions  

No CSRF protection on:
- User creation
- Memory/vault creation and deletion
- Entry modifications

**Recommendation**: Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations.

### 9. Missing Security Headers
**Location**: HTTP responses  
**Impact**: Various client-side attacks  

Missing headers:
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- Content-Security-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security

**Recommendation**: Add security headers middleware.

### 10. Weak Error Handling
**Location**: Throughout codebase  
**Impact**: Information disclosure  

Error messages expose internal details:
- Database errors returned to clients
- Stack traces in responses
- Internal service names and versions

**Evidence**:
```go
platformHttp.WriteInternalError(w, err.Error()) // Exposes internal errors
```

**Recommendation**: Implement generic error messages for clients, log details internally.

### 11. No Request Size Limits
**Location**: API endpoints accepting JSON  
**Impact**: DoS, memory exhaustion  

No limits on:
- Request body size
- JSON nesting depth
- Array sizes in requests

**Recommendation**: Implement request size limits and JSON parsing limits.

### 12. Dependency Vulnerabilities
**Location**: `go.mod`  
**Impact**: Various depending on vulnerability  

Using older versions of dependencies that may have known vulnerabilities:
- Should run `govulncheck` regularly
- No automated dependency updates

**Recommendation**: Implement automated dependency scanning and updates.

## Low Severity Issues 🟢

### 13. Information Disclosure in API
**Location**: API responses  
**Impact**: Minor information leakage  

- User existence can be determined through different error messages
- Timing attacks possible on user lookups
- Version information exposed in responses

### 14. Weak Regex Patterns
**Location**: `internal/api/validate/validate.go`  
**Impact**: Bypass validation  

Email regex is too permissive and may accept invalid emails.

### 15. No Audit Logging
**Location**: System-wide  
**Impact**: Forensics and compliance  

No audit trail for:
- User actions
- Administrative operations
- Security events

## Docker Security Concerns

### 16. Container Security
**Location**: Docker configurations  
**Impact**: Container escape, privilege escalation  

Issues found:
- No user namespace remapping
- Containers run as root
- No security profiles (AppArmor/SELinux)
- Exposed ports without network segmentation

## Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. **Implement Authentication**: Add JWT/OAuth2 authentication immediately
2. **Add Authorization**: Implement RBAC or similar authorization system
3. **Fix SQL Injection**: Audit and fix all SQL query construction
4. **Enable HTTPS**: Enforce TLS for all communications

### Short-term Actions (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement comprehensive input validation
2. Add rate limiting
3. Set up security headers
4. Implement CSRF protection
5. Add request size limits

### Medium-term Actions (1 month)
1. Implement audit logging
2. Set up automated security scanning
3. Implement secrets management
4. Add security monitoring and alerting

### Long-term Actions
1. Regular security audits
2. Penetration testing
3. Security training for developers
4. Implement security champions program

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Security Testing Suite**: Create automated security tests
2. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular pentests
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Automate with tools like Snyk or GitHub security
4. **Static Analysis**: Integrate security linters

## Compliance Considerations

Given that this system handles personal data:
1. **GDPR Compliance**: Implement data protection measures
2. **Right to Deletion**: Ensure complete data removal
3. **Data Encryption**: Implement encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Access Logs**: Maintain audit trails for compliance

## Conclusion

The current system has significant security vulnerabilities that must be addressed before any production deployment. The lack of authentication is the most critical issue that essentially makes all other security measures ineffective. Immediate action is required to implement basic security controls.

The architecture follows clean patterns which will make security improvements easier to implement, but security must be built into every layer of the application, not added as an afterthought.
