# Security Policy

## ⚠️ Early Development Notice

**Mycelian is in early development and not ready for production use.** A thorough security review has not been done yet, as the current focus is on building core functionality and experimenting with architecture.

## Current Approach

**Right now, I'm focused on:**
- Building core functionality
- Iterative improvements through PRs
- Architectural experimentation
- Learning from community feedback

**For security specifically:**
- Feel free to open issues for security concerns
- PRs welcome for security improvements
- Let's brainstorm architectural security patterns together
- Formal security processes will come when approaching production readiness

## Getting Involved

If you're interested in helping improve Mycelian's security:
- Open GitHub issues for security concerns
- Submit PRs with security improvements
- Discuss architecture ideas in issues/discussions
- Help design security-first patterns as we build
