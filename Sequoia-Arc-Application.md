# Mycelian Memory - Sequoia Arc Application

## Executive Summary

**What we're building**: Mycelian Memory is an open-source memory platform that enables AI agents to reliably retain and recall information across sessions, weeks, and months. We provide durable, queryable memory with modular components that teams can configure for their specific cost, performance, and accuracy requirements.

**Why we're building it**: Current AI agents forget everything between sessions, limiting their usefulness for real applications. Existing memory solutions are either closed-source black boxes, operationally complex graph systems, or unreliable LLM-based approaches. The market needs infrastructure that developers can trust, inspect, and modify.

**Why we can build it**: This is fundamentally a data engineering problem disguised as an AI challenge. It requires deep expertise in distributed systems, storage architectures, and production ML infrastructure—exactly the background needed to solve it correctly. Most innovation lies ahead of us, and with the right technical team focused exclusively on memory, we can build the definitive solution.

## Who I Am and Why This Problem

I'm Sameer Choudhary, and I spent years building distributed storage and ML infrastructure at Amazon. When I took an AI agent from concept to production, creating reliable context emerged as one of the most challenging engineering problems. Agents that couldn't remember previous conversations were practically useless for real applications.

I left Amazon in July 2025 to work on this full-time because I believe persistent memory is the missing foundation layer for practical AI agents. I've validated the core approach—my prototype accurately answers questions over 50-turn multi-session conversations. I use Mycelian daily for my own coding and research, which keeps me grounded in real developer needs.

## What I'm Building Differently

**Open source by design**: The AI community values transparency and control. Current solutions either went closed-source (Zep) or have poorly maintained communities (Mem0). Genuine open source builds trust and enables the ecosystem contributions needed for this infrastructure layer.

**Modular architecture**: Teams need to swap embeddings providers, vector databases, and storage backends without rewriting application logic. Most solutions lock you into their specific choices or cloud provider ecosystems.

**Data engineering focus**: This isn't primarily an AI problem requiring novel algorithms. It's about building reliable, scalable infrastructure that handles precision, recall, durability, and cost optimization. The innovation opportunity lies in getting the engineering fundamentals right.

**Performance flexibility**: Different use cases need different trade-offs. High-value workflows demand maximum accuracy, while everyday tasks can accept lower precision for better cost and speed. The platform should let developers dial these parameters rather than force a single "best" configuration.

## Market and Competition

OpenAI reports 3 million active developers building with their APIs. AWS and GCP recently launched memory services, validating market demand. Existing solutions fail because they either sacrifice reliability (Mem0's LLM summarization), create operational complexity (Zep's temporal graphs), or lock developers into proprietary ecosystems.

The real opportunity is that most of the innovation is still ahead of us. Memory for AI agents is where databases were in the early 1980s—lots of different approaches, no clear winners, massive room for a focused team to build the standard solution.

## Execution Plan

**August 15**: Open source release with core memory APIs and Go SDK  
**September 30**: SaaS offering with usage-based pricing  
**Looking for**: Technical co-founder, likely senior PM from AWS AI team with GTM experience

I'm not waiting for perfect conditions. Every day more developers hit memory limitations with their agents. The window to build the definitive solution is open now.
