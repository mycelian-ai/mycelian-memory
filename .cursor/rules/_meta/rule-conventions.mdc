# Cursor Rule Authoring Conventions

• Start every rule file with a YAML header enclosed by `---` delimiters containing at least:
  • `description`: short summary.
  • `alwaysApply: true|false` (omit or set false for Agent-Requested rules).
  • Optional `globs:` for Auto-Attached rules.

• Keep each rule focused and ≤500 lines. Split large concepts into multiple files.

• Choose the appropriate rule type:
  1. **Always** – `alwaysApply: true`.
  2. **Auto-Attached** – add `globs:` patterns to trigger on path matches.
  3. **Agent-Requested** – `alwaysApply: false`; AI decides when to load.
  4. **Manual** – mentioned explicitly with `@ruleName`.

• Place domain-specific rules in nested `.cursor/rules/` directories close to code they govern.

• Reference example snippets or templates with `@filename.ext` when helpful; Cursor will attach them automatically.

• Update or supersede rules instead of editing history – keep provenance clear.

• Keep structure shallow: H1 title, H2 primary sections; avoid deeper headings.
• No decorative emojis; use ✅ ⏳ ❌ only when conveying status.
