# Continuous Integration Requirements

Every pull request **must** pass these automated checks:

1. `go fmt ./...` – code formatted.
2. `go vet ./...` – static analysis clean.
3. `go test -race ./...` – all tests pass with race detector.
4. `golangci-lint run` – linter passes with configured rules.
5. `govulncheck ./...` – no known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
6. Build in `-tags=production` mode (if tags used).

The CI pipeline should fail fast if any step above is non-zero.

# Dependency Hygiene

* Run `go list -m -u all` weekly; open PRs for outdated critical deps.
* Remove superseded packages (e.g., `pkg/memoryclient`) in the same PR once migration is validated.
