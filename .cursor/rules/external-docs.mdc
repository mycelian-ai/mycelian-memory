# On-Demand External Documentation (generic)

To bring a large reference file into the prompt **only when it is needed**:

1. Mention it with the tag  
   `@docs/<relative-path>.md`  
   Example: `@docs/reference/api-documentation.md`

2. The agent will attach that file (or the relevant section) to the conversation context.

Guidelines
• Use the tag **exactly**; no wildcard fetching.  
• Prefer section-level links (e.g., `@docs/reference/api-documentation.md#rate-limits`) when you only need part of a big file.  
• Keep reference files lean—split very large docs into smaller ones (<300 lines) if possible.
