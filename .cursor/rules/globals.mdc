Use on writting well principles while communicating
• Be concise, professional; prefer bullet lists, no superlatives.
• One small feature at a time; fix root causes, not symptoms.
• Conventional commit format: type(scope): subject (≤50 chars, imperative).
• Begin each task with a short bullet-list "Plan → Act"; execute immediately unless input is missing.
• Never echo credentials, tokens, or full stack traces; redact sensitive data.
• Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly; if unsure, say so rather than guessing.
