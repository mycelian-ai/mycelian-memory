# Roadmap Folder Organisation

## Purpose
Normalize how milestones, stories, and tasks are represented on disk so Cursor agents and humans can locate and update them consistently.

## Directory Schema
```text
_docs/product/milestones/_
  <num>-<slug>/                 # milestone folder (e.g., 02-go-client-sdk)
    README.md                   # milestone overview (optional)
    stories/
      <storyId>-<slug>.md       # story markdown with short ID prefix
```
* `<num>` ‚Äì zero-padded integer (e.g. `02`).
* `<slug>` ‚Äì lowercase words separated by hyphens.
* Task numbers increment by three digits for easy insertion.

### Task Recording
* **Preferred**: maintain a single **Task table** inside `story.md` with columns: Order, Title, Brief, Status.
* Separate `tasks/*.md` files are optional; create only when task merits detailed spec or separate PR discussion.

## File Requirements
| File | Must include |
|------|--------------|
| milestone/README.md | status icon, target date, KPI, exit criteria |
| story.md | problem statement, links to ADR/design, DoD checklist |
| tasks/*.md | conventional commit suggestion, checkboxes, PR link |

## Status Icons
‚úÖ done ‚Ä¢ ‚è≥ in-progress ‚Ä¢ üîú planned ‚Ä¢ ‚ùå removed

## Update Rules
1. Add/update roadmap files **in the same PR** as the implementation.
2. When a task closes, mark ‚úÖ and add a one-line outcome.
3. Hotfixes live in `roadmap/hotfixes.md` and reference the affected story.

## CI Lint
`scripts/validate_roadmap.sh` enforces naming patterns and markdown headers.
